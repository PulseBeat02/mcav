# Contributions to the MCAV Project

I welcome all contributors to the MCAV project. Contributing is incredibly easy. In general, I require all contributions
to follow the following guidelines:

- Appropriate (is it reasonable, necessary?)
- Code quality (follow OOP, avoid DRY code, etc.)
- Code formatting (follow Google Code Format for Java)
