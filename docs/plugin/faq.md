### **I'm getting an `UnsatisfiedLinkError` saying that version `GLIBC_2.38` is not found, how do I fix this?**

The error indicates that your system's GLibC version is way too old for VLC to use. To fix this, you have to install
a newer version of GLibC. If you are on a dedicated server provider, you would have to contact them to see if they are
able to update this library for you.
