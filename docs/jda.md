## JDA Module

When you want to use JDA alongside MCAV, you can use the JDA module which provides many lightweight classes for
providing audio to your bot. To start, add the following dependency to your `build.gradle.kts` file:

```kts
dependencies {
    implementation("me.brandonli:mcav-jda:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT")
}
```
