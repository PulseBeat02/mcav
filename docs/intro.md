## Java Multimedia Framework

MCAV (pronounced *EM CAV*) is an incredibly powerful multimedia library for [Java](https://www.java.com/en/), serving
as the successor of EzMediaCore2. MCAV utilizes several low-level libraries like [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/),
[OpenCV](https://opencv.org/), and LibVLC (from [VLC media player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/)) to provide a seamless
playback experience for developers and
users. Designed for pure performance and compatability, MCAV isn't just a YouTube player, but a robust player for
live-streams, local files, and even a web browser.

MCAV is not a library just for Java developers but also a great library to integrate Minecraft plugins with. While you
can use MCAV in any Java project, there's also a Minecraft-specific module that provides useful features allowing you
to play back videos like the following.
