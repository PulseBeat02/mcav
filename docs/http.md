## HTTP Module

When you want to play your audio into an HTTP web browser, you can take advantage of the HTTP module which uses JavaLin
under the hood. To start, add the following dependency to your `build.gradle.kts` file:

```kts
dependencies {
    implementation("me.brandonli:mcav-http:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT")
}
```
