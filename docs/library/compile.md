# Compiling MCAV

Compiling mcav is incredibly easy.

- Clone the repository from GitHub, and navigate to the directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PulseBeat02/mcav.git
cd mcav
```

- Run the Gradle wrapper to build the project:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

- Profit! If you are looking for the plugin jar, it will be located in the `/sandbox/plugin/build/libs` directory. Use the jar
with the "-all" suffix for the plugin.
