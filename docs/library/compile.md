# Compiling MCAV

Compiling mcav is incredibly easy.

1) Clone the repository from GitHub, and navigate to the directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PulseBeat02/mcav.git
cd mcav
```

2) Run the gradle wrapper to build the project:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

3) Profit! If you are looking for the plugin jar, it will be located in the `/sandbox/build/libs` directory. Use the jar
with the "-all" suffix for the plugin.
